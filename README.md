L0183 is a Graffiticode dialect for **concept webs**: a hub in the centre, nodes on a circle
around it, and lines between them that may carry labels. Any node — the hub included — and any
line can be a **blank** the learner fills by dragging an answer from a tray. It inherits the base
vocabulary of [@graffiticode/l0000](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graffiticode/l0000), and
succeeds [L0169](https://github.com/graffiticode/l0169).

```
concept-web [
  hub text "The Cell" {}
  nodes [
    node text "Nucleus" {}
    node text "Mitochondria" assess [expected] {}
    node text "Ribosome" assess [expected] {}
    node text "Cell membrane" assess [expected] {}
    node text "Chlorophyll" assess [distractor] {}
  ] {}
] title "Parts of a cell" instructions "Drag each part onto an empty node." {}..
```

- A blank carries its answer as its text; the compiler hides it and builds the tray from the
  answers plus the `assess [distractor]` members, so the tray can never disagree with the key.
- Blanks whose places in the web cannot be told apart accept each other's answers.
- Scoring is partial credit per blank, and the compiled output is in the cell-scoring shape of
  Graffiticode's Learnosity custom questions — an L0176 item embeds a web with
  `custom [lang "0183" …]`, served from this repo's `question.js` / `scorer.js`.
- Drag with mouse or touch, or select-then-place from the keyboard.
